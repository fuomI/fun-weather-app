# Fun Weather App

This is a weather app that I made during Laurea UAS' Fullstack development -course.

The user can pick a city and the application shows the temperature and weather condition
of said city.

## Styles
- **Pure css**

## Technologies
- **Node.js**
- **Express**
- **Pug view engine**

## Problems

Unfortunately the API call to the weatherstack.com can be made only using
http with free account.
